# Lab Description

In this course lab, we will actively implement algorithms and methods that have been introduced during our class
sessions. The primary goal of this lab is to provide you with hands-on experience and practical insights into the world
of machine learning and data science.

We will closely follow the content of the "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" book. At the end of each chapter,
the book offers comprehensive examples accompanied by Python code, enabling you to gain a deep understanding of the
various methods covered in our classes. It is highly encouraged to work through these examples after each class session.
Additionally, we will integrate select lab exercises from the book

After completing the labs, you will have the opportunity to work on assignments that will further enhance your
understanding of the course.

## Setup

You have the flexibility to work in an environment of your choice, whether it's on your personal computer, a cloud
service, using Python scripts, or in a Jupyter notebook.

While we strongly recommend working on your personal computer for the best experience, you can also start the lab
sessions
using [noto](https://www.epfl.ch/education/educational-initiatives/jupyter-notebooks-for-education/one-click-access-to-jupyter-notebooks-online-with-noto/).
Noto is a cloud-based Jupyter Server provided by the university with pre-installed libraries. Please note that using
Noto requires a stable internet connection and may sometimes be slower depending on server traffic.

You can log in and work with [noto](https://noto.epfl.ch/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F) using your university credentials.

## Python Packages

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It is widely used in
various domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. Python has a
large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks, making it a powerful tool for a
wide range of tasks.

We will work with some of the most popular Python packages for machine learning and data science:

1. **Data handling:**
    - `numpy`: a fundamental Python package for numerical operations, providing support for arrays and matrices, as well
      as mathematical functions. You can explore
      its [API documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html).
        - [User guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html)
    - `pandas`: a versatile Python package for data manipulation and analysis, particularly suited for working with
      structured data in tabular form. For detailed information, check
      the [API documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html).
        - [User guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)

2. **Plot libraries:**
    - `matplotlib`: a highly customizable Python package for creating static, animated, and interactive plots, making it
      an essential tool for data visualization. Refer to
      the [API documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html) for in-depth information.
        - [User guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html)
    - `seaborn`: built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn offers a high-level interface for creating informative and
      attractive statistical graphics. Explore the [API documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html) for advanced
      usage, and you can also find a variety of already implemented plots in
      its [gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html).
        - [User guide](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html)

3. **Machine learning:**
    - `Sklearn` (Scikit-learn): a comprehensive Python library for machine learning, featuring a wide array of
      algorithms and tools for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and more. For detailed
      functionality, refer to the [API documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html).
        - [User guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
    - `pytorch`: an open-source deep learning framework that provides a flexible platform for building and training
      neural networks. Delve into the [API documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) for advanced
      usage.
        - [User guide](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html)
    - `tensorflow`: another popular deep learning framework, TensorFlow offers flexibility and scalability for building
      and deploying machine learning and deep learning models. Explore
      the [API documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf) for comprehensive information.
        - [User guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/basics)

These packages will serve as the foundation for your exploration of machine learning and data science concepts
throughout this course.

## Contact

You are encouraged to talk to us in class. If that is not possible, you can use Ilias for course content and assignment questions. You can use e-mail for personal issues, or to arrange a meeting during office hours.

### General inquires, technical problems

First, if you are stuck on something, ask in class. That is why we don't just record lectures and labs. If you do show up, make sure to ask if something is unclear.

After the class, you can **use the forum on Ilias** https://ilias.unibe.ch/ilias.php?ref_id=2868486&cmdClass=ilobjforumgui&cmdNode=11q:rm&baseClass=ilRepositoryGUI
This helps other students that might have the same question. Do not send emails for questions about the course content. If a question is hard to answer online, then we will do it in class or during office hours.

### Personal issues and office hours

If you have personal issues, or anything else requiring a personalised answer, or if you wish to schedule an appointment during office hours, you should use e-mail.
